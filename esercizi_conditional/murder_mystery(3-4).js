/*
 * Programming Quiz: Murder Mystery (3-4)
   We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...

  the poison belongs to the ballroom,
  the trophy belongs to the gallery,
  the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
  and the knife belongs to the dining room.
  And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.

  Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
  Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
  Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
  Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.

  To help solve this mystery, write a combination
  of conditional statements that:
  -sets the value of weapon based on the room and
  -sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
*/
// change the value of `room` and `suspect` to test your code

var room = "dining room";
var suspect = "Mr. Parkes";

var weapon = "";
var solved = false;

if (room === "ballroom" && suspect === "Mr. Kalehoff") {
    weapon = "poison";
    solved = true;
} else if (room === "gallery" && suspect === "Ms. Van Cleve") {
    weapon = "trophy";
    solved = true;
} else if (room === "billiards room" && suspect === "Mrs. Sparr") {
    weapon = "pool stick";
    solved = true;
} else if (room === "dining room" && suspect === "Mr. Parkes") {
    weapon = "knife";
    solved = true;
}

if (solved) {
	console.log(suspect + " did it in the " + room + " with the " + weapon + "!");
}
